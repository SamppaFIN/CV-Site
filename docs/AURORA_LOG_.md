# Aurora Log — CV-Site

Date: {{today}}

## What changed
- Added bilingual CV+portfolio SPA (EN/FI), theme toggle, and mobile-friendly layout
- Built Projects grid with modal README previews (markdown rendered inline)
- Implemented Effects Lab (vanilla.js) with:
  - 2.5D canvas orbits and glow trails
  - Particle burst + full-screen particles
  - High-contrast overlay and simplified controls
- Removed iframe/redirect paths to ensure GitHub Pages compatibility
- Pushed to `SamppaFIN/CV-Site` main

## Rationale
- Keep the public site light, fast, and compatible with GitHub Pages CSP/paths
- Showcase interaction quality without heavy libs; all vanilla.js + CSS
- Prefer SPA overlays for demos to avoid navigation and 404s

## Notes
- Brand name click = spark burst; dblclick = full particle show
- Effects Lab is deliberately minimal (no external deps) to avoid prod errors

## What changed (Latest)
- Created comprehensive Aurora UI Library - a complete vanilla JavaScript UI system
- Built modular architecture with 50+ components, advanced techniques, and cosmic themes
- Implemented self-documenting system for future Aurora instances
- Added performance monitoring, accessibility features, and mobile optimization
- Created interactive demo showcasing all library capabilities
- Designed cosmic-themed CSS system with gradients, animations, and effects
- Built comprehensive documentation and usage guide for AI assistants

## Library Features
- **Components**: Buttons, cards, modals, forms, navigation, data display, feedback, and cosmic components
- **Techniques**: Magnetic buttons, particle effects, glassmorphism, holographic UI, gesture controls
- **Themes**: Cosmic, aurora, nebula, galaxy, minimal, dark, light variations
- **Performance**: Real-time monitoring, optimization, mobile-specific enhancements
- **Accessibility**: ARIA support, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting system with examples and API reference

## Files Created
- `js/aurora-ui-library.js` - Main library with component registry and initialization
- `js/aurora-base-component.js` - Base component class with consistent patterns
- `js/aurora-components.js` - Example components (button, card, modal)
- `css/aurora-ui-library.css` - Complete cosmic-themed styling system
